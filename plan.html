			<h2>BOT.NET</h2>
			<p><b>Battle of the Internet</b> is a game I and a friend came up with. The goal of the game is to <i>hack</i> other players, gain money, and reputation in the hacker underworld.<br>When all is done we plan to feature an in-game <b>Terminal</b> where most of the game will be played. While quite unrealistic, we aim to bring the most practical experience yet. We hope that this game will educate its players teaching them the basics of the <b>UNIX OS</b> and dangers of malicious users.</p>

				<tr>
					<td>Home</td>
					<td>This will welcome the user and introduce them to the site and game play etc.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Contact</td>
					<td>This will hold a form element where people can send us requests and ideas.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Updates</td>
					<td>This will contain news about development and what not.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Register</td>
					<td>This is where people can register their email to receive automatic email updates.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Login</td>
					<td>This button will be faded out until an alpha version is released.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Ranking</td>
					<td>(This won't be relevant until an alpha version is released.) This page will contain a table of users sorted by their reputation. When scrolling to the bottom of the page, new users will be loaded. I might add a search bar, but that won't be fully operational till we host this on a server which supports PHP.</td>
